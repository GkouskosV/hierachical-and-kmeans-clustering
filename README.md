# Hierachical and kmeans clustering using matlab

This exercise makes use of the unsupervised learning hierachical clustering algorithm and kmeans. The data points are artifitially generated and are considered to be sampled from three different multivariate distributions.

To plot the Probability Density Function, euclidean distance is being used.<br>
K-means clustering is performed 3 times:
1. Division datapoints to 2 clusters
2. Division datapoints to 3 clusters
3. Division datapoints to 7 clusters

Finally, the hierachical clustering algorithms  and dendogram are used.
